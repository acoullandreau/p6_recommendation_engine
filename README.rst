==================================================
IBM Recommendation Engine - Udacity DSND project 6
==================================================


-----------------------
Purpose of this project
-----------------------

As part of the UDACITY Data Scientist Nanodegree, I worked on a **recommendation engine** project. The purpose of this project was to implement a few methods to recommend articles to user based on the data coming from the IBM Watson Studio platform:

- rank based approach
- user-user collaborative filtering
- content based approach (NLP techniques applied to the description of each article)
- SVD

We were guided through, and the Jupyter notebook of this repository traces back each step and result.

As to bring this project to another level, I also implement a python module that simply provides a list of articles as recommendations for a given user. 

In this repository, you will find:

- A Jupyter notebook
- An html version of the notebook
- A folder containing all files required to run the python module
- This readme file


-----------------------
Installation requisites
-----------------------

| To document the code, I used Jupyter notebook 6.0.0.
| The code is written in Python 3 (v3.6).

The following libraries were used extensively in the code:

- numpy 1.16.4
- pandas 0.25.0
- sklearn 0.21.2
- nltk 3.4.4
- plotly 4.1.1


--------------------
How to use this code
--------------------

The Jupyter notebook is divided into several subsections, and markdown cells exposes the approach and the conclusions. Code cells in between are followed by their output printed.
Feel free to reuse any piece of code, or walk through the notebook to get an insight on the method and decisions taken!
A complete readme is available in the python module folder, feel free to reuse any code as well!

This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree, and the workbook was provided as a base to complete the project.
